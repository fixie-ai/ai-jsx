/**
 * Use a Large Language Model to steer the control flow of your application.
 *
 * You give this component two pieces: `children`, which contains {@link Route}s, and `query`, which is used to steer. The
 * model will pick the {@link Route} that's the best match for the `query`.
 *
 * ```tsx
 *    <NaturalLanguageRouter query="I'd like to cancel my account.">
 *      <Route when='the user would like to cancel'>
 *        <CancelRoute />
 *      </Route>
 *      <Route when='the user would like to upgrade'>
 *        <Upgrade />
 *      </Route>
 *      <Route noMatch>
 *       I'm sorry, but I can't help with that.
 *      </Route>
 *    </NaturalLanguageRouter>
 * ```
 *
 * Typically, instead of hardcoding `query` as in the example above, you'd be receiving it from user input.
 *
 * The {@link Route}s do not need to be the direct descendents of the {@link NaturalLanguageRouter}:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <NaturalLanguageRouter query="I'd like to cancel my account.">
 *    <><Route when='the user would like to cancel'></>
 *    {() => <Route when='the user would like to upgrade'></>}
 *    <SomeOtherComponentThatReturnsARoute />
 * </NaturalLanguageRouter>
 * ```
 *
 * However, you can't use nested Route components. If a {@link Route} contains another {@link Route},
 * the inner {@link Route}'s `when` will not be considered. The inner {@link Route} will always show
 * its children. For example:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <NaturalLanguageRouter>
 *  <Route when='first option'>...</Route>
 *  <Route when='second option'>
 *    <Route when='third option'>This will always be shown</Route>
 *  </Route>
 * ```
 *
 * The router will find the first two routes, and ask the model to pick between "first option" and "second option".
 * "third option" will not be presented as a choice, and its children will always be rendered.
 *

 *
 * Whereas this approach is just focusing very narrowly on "pick a route", and only asking the model to emit a single

 *
 * I suspect the former approach will be more robust and easier to program as models get more accurate, but I think this
