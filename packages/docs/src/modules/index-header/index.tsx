          AI.JSX is a framework for building AI applications using Javascript and JSX. You get great support for prompt
          engineering, Document Question + Answering, and using external Tools (APIs). You can provide a set of React
          components to the LLM and have your UI constructed dynamically at runtime (AKA GenUI). Bring all these to life
          in a Sidekick or use them as building blocks in other apps.
