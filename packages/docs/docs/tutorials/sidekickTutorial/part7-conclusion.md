# Part 7 - Conclusion and Next Steps

If you made it this far, here's a shout-out for hanging in there and building a Fixie Sidekick! You now have all the knowledge needed to start making custom Sidekicks for just about anything.

Let's recap what we covered:

- **Part 1** → We were introduced to Sidekicks, set-up our dev environment, and cloned the template code.
- **Part 2** → Learned about DocsQA, how to start using an existing Document Collection in a Sidekick, and how to create new collections.
- **Part 3** → The importance of the System Message, how to break it up using JSX components, and how to iteratively tweak the message as our Sidekick evolved.
- **Part 4** → How Sidekicks can get new capabilities using Tools, how to define new Tools, and how to use the GitHub GraphQL API.
- **Part 5** → Moving beyond simple, text-based chat with GenUI, how to use the built-in components, and how to create custom UI components using JSX.
- **Part 6** → The three types of Sidekicks embedding that come out of the box and how to use this to embed a Sidekick on a web page.

We would love to hear your feedback, entertain any PRs you might want to make, and work with you as you build out Sidekicks or other projects!
