# Part 1 - Introduction to Sidekicks

## Welcome

In this tutorial, we're going to create a sidekick for a movie review website. Before we jump in, you might be
asking, "What is a sidekick and why do I care?" Those are great questions!

:::info What is a sidekick?
A sidekick is an embeddable, AI-powered conversational assistant. Sidekicks augment the main experience provided in an application.
Sidekicks are experts in their given domain, can dynamically call out to other APIs, and are able to generate rich user interfaces
dynamically at runtime.

### Why Build a Sidekick

There are many reasons to build a Sidekick for your website or application:

1. End-user Experience → An embedded Sidekick is an AI-powered assistant that can serve as a guide to end-users. The content is rich and dynamic and is much more relevant and engaging than canned FAQ's.
1. Provide Support → Sidekicks can be trained on your website, docs, or any other content that is relevant and can respond with the right answer to complex and varied questions from end-users.

## What You Will Learn & Build

This tutorial is broken up into multiple parts. They are designed to be followed in sequence.

In this tutorial you will:

- Learn about Fixie Sidekicks, understand how they work, and when to use them.
- Build and deploy a working Sidekick for GitHub.
- Understand the value of DocsQA (AKA RAG), tools, and generative UI.
- Have resources to go deeper and start building custom Sidekicks of your own.

:::tip Pre-requisites

This tutorial requires you to have a GitHub account and to generate a read-only API access token. This enables us to build a Sidekick that can call out to the GitHub APIs so we can demonstrate how Sidekicks use tools.

The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and use this API access token in a safe way. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one for free at TODO.
