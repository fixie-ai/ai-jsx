# Foxie (AKA "the Fixie fox")

Meet Foxie. She is the Fixie mascot. Unlike wild foxes, Foxie doesn’t avoid humans…she looks to help them accomplish hard things.

Foxie is highly intelligent, adaptable, and playful. In Chinese culture, foxes are believed to be able to shape-shift. Foxie represents
this shape-shifting ability with her ability to seamlessly move across the “pro-code” to “no code” spectrum, making tools and
capabilities that are delightful for everyone from professional software developers writing custom applications on top of LLMs
to non-technical information workers who are looking to leverage the power of AI to get stuff done.
