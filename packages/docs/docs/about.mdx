# AI.JSX

AI.JSX is a framework that helps you build [AI-powered apps](./guides/brand-new.md). It aims to solve the following problems for developers:

- “How do I get data into my LLM call?”
- “How do I easily switch between model providers?”
- “How do I performantly chain the results of LLM calls together?”
- “How do I take advantage of community tools + patterns (e.g. chain of thought)?”
- “How do I make the model use tools?”
- “How do I constrain the model’s output?”
- “How do I structure my app in a post-AI world?”

JSX provides a powerful substrate on which to build apps that address these needs.

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ChatCompletion>
      <SystemMessage>You are an assistant who only uses one syllable words.</SystemMessage>
      <UserMessage>Why is the sky blue?</UserMessage>
    </ChatCompletion>
  );
}

showInspector(<App />);
// ==> "Sky blue due to light."
```

# Live Example

The following is a CodeSandbox sandbox that shows a simple Hello World AI.JSX app.
You can edit the code and see the results live in the browser.

1. Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the environment variables in the CodeSandbox UI.
1. In the `Run Hello World` tab, click the "Reload" icon to re-run the app with your changes.

export const SandboxExample = () => (
  <iframe
    style={{
      border: '1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
      borderRadius: '2px',
    }}
    width="100%"
    height="700"
    src="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/late-pond-rnf95v?embed=1"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
);
<SandboxExample />;

- [JSX](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/reactjs) (that overview is React-specific but almost everything is transferrable to JSX generally).
