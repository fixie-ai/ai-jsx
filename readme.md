AI.JSX is a framework for building AI applications using Javascript and [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx). While AI.JSX [is not React](https://docs.ai-jsx.com/is-it-react), it's designed to look and feel very similar while also integrating seamlessly with React-based projects. With AI.JSX, you don't just use JSX to describe what your UI should look like, you also use it to describe how **Large Language Models**, such as ChatGPT, should integrate into the rest of your application. The end result is a powerful combination where _intelligence_ can be deeply embedded into the application stack.

AI.JSX is designed to give you two important capabilities out of the box:

1. An intuitive mechanism for orchestrating multiple LLM calls expressed as modular, re-usable components.
1. The ability to seamlessly interweave UI components with your AI components. This means you can rely on the LLM to construct your UI dynamically from a set of standard React components.

AI.JSX can be used to create standalone LLM applications that can be deployed anywhere Node.JS is supported, or it can be used as part of a larger React application. Right now we recommend using NextJS, and we have [an example NextJS project](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ai-jsx/tree/main/packages/nextjs-demo) to get you started. For more details, see our [AI+UI guide](https://docs.ai-jsx.com/guides/ai-ui).
You can also check out the [live demo app](https://ai-jsx-create-react-app-demo.vercel.app/).

To get started, see the quickstart below, read our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.ai-jsx.com/getting-started), or check out the [examples](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ai-jsx/tree/main/packages/examples).

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started is to [clone our template repo](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ai-jsx-template) or [check out an example on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/late-pond-rnf95v). But here's how to do it manually:

Create your folder and `cd` into it:

```console
mkdir ai-jsx-example && cd ai-jsx-example
```

Install Typescript:

```console
npm i typescript --save-dev
```

Initialize a new Typescript project:

```console
npx tsc --init
```

Install `ai-jsx`:

```console
npm i ai-jsx
```

Set up your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "ai-jsx-hello-world",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc",
    "start": "npm run typecheck && tsx index.tsx"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ai-jsx": "^0.2.0-4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tsconfig/node18": "^2.0.1",
    "tsx": "^3.12.7",
    "typescript": "^5.1.3"
  }
}
```

Set up your `tsconfig.json` to use AI.JSX's JSX support:

```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/node18/tsconfig.json",
  "include": ["index.tsx"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react",
    "jsxFactory": "AI.createElement",
    "jsxFragmentFactory": "AI.Fragment",
    "moduleResolution": "node16",
    "module": "esnext",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "noEmit": true
  }
}
```

Create a new `index.tsx` file with the following simple example:

```tsx
import * as AI from 'ai-jsx';
import { ChatCompletion, SystemMessage, UserMessage } from 'ai-jsx/core/completion';

function App() {
  return (
    <ChatCompletion>
      <SystemMessage>You are an agent that only gives snarky, sarcastic advice.</SystemMessage>
      <UserMessage>How can I learn about Ancient Egypt?</UserMessage>
    </ChatCompletion>
  );
}

console.log(await AI.createRenderContext().render(<App />));
```

## Features

- Prompt engineering through modular, reusable components
- The ability to easily switch between model providers and LLM configurations (e.g., temperature)
- Built in support for Tools (ReAct pattern), Document Question and Answering, Chain of Thought, and more
- Ability to directly interweave LLM calls with standard UI components, including the ability for the LLM to render the UI from a set of provided components
- Built-in streaming support
- First-class support for NextJS and Create React App (more coming soon)
- Full support for LangChainJS
