## Working in this repo

### Monorepo

We use [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces/#gatsby-focus-wrapper) to manage the [monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook).

```
# Run a command at the top level:
$ yarn test

# Run a command for a particular monorepo package
$ yarn workspace @fixieai/ai-jsx add my-package-name
```

If one monorepo package depends on another, the dependee compiles its TS files to `dist`. If you change a dependee, be sure to run `build` so `dist` is updated.

**Run all commands from the monorepo root, via `yarn workspace ...` or `yarn turbo ...`. Running directly from the monorepo packages is not guaranteed to work.**

### Demos

Our primary means of manual verification that things are working is the demos. You can see a full list in [examples/package.json](./packages/examples/package.json). (It's all the `scripts` that start with `demo:`.)

Run a demo like this:

```
# Build the ai-jsx package.
yarn workspace @fixieai/ai-jsx run build

# Replace demo:reddit with the name of your demo
yarn workspace examples run demo:reddit
```

Most demos will produce results using the [inspector](./packages/ai-jsx/src/inspector/console.tsx), a bare-bones [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) app:

The inspector shows the program output on the left hand side, and the debug tree on the right. The debug tree gives you some (imperfect) visibility into how your program was constructed. Use the left and right arrow keys to step through the debug tree.

Some key demos:

- `demo:reddit`: Basic Docs QA
- `demo:router`: Natural Language Router
- `demo:debate`: Chat model used to generate competing sides in a debate
- [AI UI](./docs/guides/ai-ui.md).
